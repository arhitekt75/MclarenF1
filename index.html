            <h5>McLaren MCL35 (2020)</h5>
            <p>
              The MCL35 made its début at the 2020 Austrian Grand Prix after the start of the season was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The MCL35 was driven by Carlos Sainz Jr. and Lando Norris in 2020, with McLaren finishing in third place in the World Constructors' Championship for the first time since 2012 and achieving two podiums. The same car is basically being used for the 2021 season.

            <h5>McLaren MCL32 (2017)</h5>
            <p>
              The MCL32 made its competitive début at the 2017 Australian Grand Prix. This was the last McLaren car to be fitted with a Honda engine as it was replaced by Renault engines from the 2018 season onwards. After an improvement in the previous year, 2017 was a rough season for McLaren. The cars were slow and the team's Honda engines proved to be very unreliable and slow. McLaren finished 9th in the Constructors' Championship, with 30 points.

            <h5>McLaren MP4-29 (2014)</h5>
            <p>
              The MP4-29 was McLaren's first turbo-powered Formula One car since the Honda engined MP4/4. After a third place finish in Australia, things went downhill. The team failed to record another podium finish all season. The MP4-29 was the most mechanically reliable car of the season with 36 classified finishes out of a possible 38, but it was also fifth in the Constructors' Championship.

            <p>
              The MP4-25 proved to be a stark improvement over the McLaren MP4-24. The most interesting part of the car was its F-duct, a small "snorkel" air scoop mounted in front of the driver that channels air through a duct in the cockpit and towards the rear of the car. Changes in the pressure in the duct reduced drag and allowing the car as much as an extra 6 mph. Wins 5 races and get 16 podiums..

            <p>
              The car proved to be one of the most competitive of the season, achieving eight victories. Internal infighting was the bigger story at McLaren. The low downforce package of the MP4-22 was extremely competitive. McLaren, with the aid of their improved car, scored as many team points in the first half of 2007 as they had done during the entire year in 2006.

                <p><em><q>Dear McLaren fans, 

                  When the first McLaren racing car, the M1A, rolled out of our original Feltham workshop in west London, it set into motion an incredible journey that has spanned the past six decades of competition. From humble beginnings, the company, founded by the legendary Bruce McLaren in 1963, has grown to be one of the biggest and most successful outfits in the history of the sport.
                  
                  Under his inspirational guidance, McLaren quickly established this team as a leading light in motor racing with our iconic, papaya-liveried machines thrilling fans as they powered to victory in various categories around the world. Today, our aim is to continue the legacy that Bruce started and strive for future success on the race track.</q></em></p>

              <p>The team won its first world championship in 1974 with Emerson Fittipaldi, and a second came in 1976 courtesy of James Hunt.
                  But the Teddy Mayer-run outfit fell down the grid before a takeover by Ron Dennis in the early 1980s. The reinvigorated
                  outfit pioneered the carbon fibre chassis and became the dominant force in F1 from 1984 until the early nineties, with
                  the likes of Niki Lauda, Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna winning championship.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After splitting with Honda it found a new engine partner in Mercedes and added further championships in 1998 and
                  1999, Mika Hakkinen taking the drivers’ title in both years.More might have followed in 2007 but the team was
                  implicated in a scandal over alleged spying on rivals Ferrari. Given a record fine of $100m the team were thrown out
                  of the constructors’ championship and both Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso lost the drivers’ title at the last
                  round by one point each. The team bounced back to win the drivers’ title with Hamilton in 2008.</p>
                <br>
                <p>McLaren’s association with Mercedes came to an end in 2014. The following year it reunited with Honda for the first
                  time since 1992 but sadly not to reclaim former glory. A disastrous start to the 2015 season continued into
                  frustrating 2016 where far from a brilliant re-partnership, the team saw its two former-world-champion drivers
                  frequently struggling to escape Q1.
                  At the end of 2016, the previously unthinkable happened and Ron Dennis was forced out of the team. However, regime
                  change in 2017 didn’t alter the results and neither did Button’s retirement and replacement with Stoffel Vandoorne. A
                  messy divorce from Honda and switch to Renault power in 2018 didn’t entirely right things and both Alonso and
                  Vandoorne departed the team, leaving F1.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Former Red Bull junior Carlos Sainz Jnr and 2018 Formula 2 runner-up Lando Norris replaced them and the team, with
                  the addition of former Porsche endurance boss Andreas Seidl, seemed to enter a period of steady recovery. Results
                  improved to see the cars consistently in points-paying positions and Sainz took a third place for the team in Brazil
                  2019, their first podium since Button had won the same race in 2012. 2020 saw the team further improve, with Norris
                  and Sainz taking another podium apiece and McLaren finishing third in the world constructors’ championship. However by
                  2022 they had slipped to fifth and Seidl was lured to join Sauber in advance of the team’s tie-up with Audi. Andrea
                  Stella was promoted in his place.</p>

                <img src="img/abu_dhabi_yas_marina_circuit.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Yas Marina Circuit is located on Yas Island, about 30 minutes from Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. Approximately 50,000 spectators can view the action on the circuit from permanent, covered grandstands that protect visitors from the desert sun. It is the only F1 motorsports venue in the world where all of the grandstands are covered.</p>

                 <p>The Yas Marina Circuit is 5.55 kilometers long and can be split into two smaller tracks of 3.1 kilometers and 2.4 kilometers, which can operate simultaneously where desired. A total of 21 corners with 9 right turns and 12 left turns. The width of the circuit fluctuates from 12-16 meters. The direction is anti-clockwise. The track has a lot of hairpins and long straights and there is few potential overtaking places. The pit lane entry is very challenging, as is the exit, which runs underneath the track in a tunnel.
                 </p> 
                 <p>At 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand prix, for the first time in Formula 1 history, a race was scheduled to start in daylight and end during night-time. The race was started approximately one hour before sunset. The permanent lighting system was turned on from the start of the race to ensure a seamless transition from daylight to dark.
                  
                  The world's largest indoor theme park, Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, is also located on Yas Island. The park hosts more than 20 rides and attractions. One of the attractions, Formula Rossa, has the same G force one would feel driving in an F1 car and braking at maximum speed. It is the world's fastest roller coaster, powered through the 2.07 km track at speeds up to 240 km/h, reaching 0-100 km/h in less than two seconds. It is so intense that passengers have to protect their eyes with goggles.</p>

                  <p>Hungaroring is regarded as very challenging and tough for the drivers, but also as one of the safest race tracks in Formula 1.

                <h3>James HUNT</h3>
                <p>No driver before or since has played the role of the Formula One playboy as much as James Hunt.
                Sex, drugs and alcohol were all a staple part of Hunt's diet even on race weekends but he was still very focused and seriously quick once the visor was down.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Hunt spent three years with McLaren from 1976-1978, but it is the 1976 season and his memorable duel with Niki Lauda for which he will forever be remembered.</p> 
                <br> 
                <p>Hunt's bravery in dangerously wet conditions in the final round in Japan enabled him to finish third and overturn a three point deficit to beat Lauda who fortuitously withdrew on safety grounds.            
                Thus, he won the title by a single point.</p>

                <h3>Niki LAUDA</h3>
                <p>Despite Hunt's dramatic 1976 triumph, Lauda was widely acknowledged as the more complete driver, and his three world titles are testimony to the fact.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Lauda was already a double world champion when he came out of retirement for the McLaren team in 1982.
                He endured two difficult seasons, winning only twice before sealing his third world title by half a point from teammate Alain Prost in 1984.</p>

                <p>A measure of consistency, David Coulthard won 12 times for McLaren in a career spanning nine seasons for the Woking based team."DC" was unlucky to be racing in the era of Michael Schumacher and teammate Mika Häkkinen and despite enjoying the quickest car in the field in both 1998 and 1999, he couldn't quite put himself in a position to contend for the title.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Coulthard finished on the podium no less than 11 times in 2000 and was briefly in title contention before fading to third in the title. He was second to Schumacher in 2001 albeit a massive 58 points adrift.
                Always a a tough competitor and big fan favourite, Coulthard deservedly makes the top 10.</p>

                <p>Mika Häkkinen burst onto the scene in his opening Grand Prix for McLaren in 1993 by outqualifying a dumbstruck Ayrton Senna in Portugal. The next three seasons were studded with podiums in a difficult car but Häkkinen got it all together in 1998 by winning eight races on his way to dominating the season. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Five more victories followed in 1999 as surprise package Eddie Irvine pushed him close to the title.
                Michael Schumacher gained revenge in 2000 as Häkkinen finished second in a valiant title defence but the Flying Finn had already booked his place in McLaren folklore and he remains one of Ron Dennis' favourite sons to this day.</p>

                <h3>Lewis HAMILTON</h3>
                <p>Nobody has come as close to winning the drivers' title in their opening season as Lewis Hamilton.
                A part of Ron Dennis' McLaren family from childhood, Hamilton took the title fight to teammate Fernando Alonso and Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen from the outset and looked on course to achieve his goal until retirement in China and seventh in Brazil allowed Raikkonen to snatch the title by a single point.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, despair turned to joy a year later when Hamilton sealed the title in the most dramatic of title finishes ever.Passing Timo Glock's ailing Toyota on the final corner meant that Hamilton took fifth place and the title by just a single point from under the nose of the already celebrating Felipe Massa.   Hamilton would go on to secure 11 more wins for McLaren before leaving the team for Mercedes in 2013.</p>

                <h3>Alain PROST</h3>
                <p>Nicknamed 'The Professor' for his calculated approach and smooth driving style, Alain Prost won three world drivers' titles for McLaren and is second on the list on that basis alone. Niki Lauda edged Prost to the title in his opening season for the team but Prost dominated in 1985 to become France's first and only world champion to date. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The following year, Prost stole the title at the final race in Adelaide after Nigel Mansell suffered a spectacular tyre blow out. However, it is for his epic battles with teammate Ayrton Senna in 1988 and 1989 that Prost's McLaren career will be remembered for.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Frenchman lost out in 88 before eventually taking the title in controversial circumstances the following year when Senna turned into him at the chicane and was subsequently disqualified for rejoining the circuit via the slip road.</p>

                <h3>Airton SENNA</h3>
                <p>No real surprise here as to who would top the list. The great Brazilian won three titles for McLaren in 1988, 1990 and 1991.In doing so, Senna broke several world records with McLaren many of which stand to this day including most consecutive pole positions (8), most consecutive front row starts (24), most consecutive wins at the same Grand Prix (5 at Monaco) and most wins for a McLaren team at 35.</p>

                <h3>Jenson BUTTON</h3>
                <p>It hasn’t been the greatest of seasons for the ‘Froome Flyer’ but he’s not been blessed with the greatest machine McLaren has ever produced in 2013. Still, it must not be forgotten that the 2009 world champion has performed admirably since his move to McLaren in 2010 and as Murray Walker highlights in the above clip, he has scored more points in the years he has been at McLaren than Lewis Hamilton did.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It’s an easily forgotten fact that Button finished second to Sebastian Vettel in the 2011 season and at the time of writing he has won eight races for the Woking based team.Button is now one of F1’s elder statesmen at 33 but who knows what the future holds and he could yet rocket up this list in the years to come.</p>
